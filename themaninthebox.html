<h1>The Man in the Box</h1>
<p>
    A deserted road. Barbed-wire twisted atop the fences on either side. Looking left, the town of Forthside stood silently in the distance. Looking right, fields stretched to a wall of murky hills that many considered the edge of the Scottish highlands. On a dark winter’s morning it wasn’t hard to see the landscape as a depopulated apocalyptic wasteland. A soundtrack of dark ambient music reaching the synapses through cheap headphones completed the imaginative transfiguration of Sharon’s daily slog to work. She suddenly realised that there weren’t even any animals in the fields and remembered the recent vicious attacks on cattle in the area that must have caused the farmers to keep their livestock in the barns. She took out her the headphones. She had almost reached the Twa Corbies Traveller’s Inn, a grey concrete block presiding over a sparsely populated car park and decrepit childrens’ play area, an unimpressive embassy of human life amidst the desolate scene.

    She made a mental preview of her process for setting up the breakfast room. Hot-plates put out, coffee and tea urns filled. The hikers always got up first and a few early risers were probably already sitting round rubbing their hands and monitoring the buffet table with scowling impatience. Sharon would ignore them and focus on getting everything arranged with the maximum economy of movement. She often fantasised herself as a hyper-efficient breakfast serving automaton, completely indifferent to the public. Maybe one day, when everything was automatised, she would be the last human employee honoured with a place among the machines. Until then she was cursed with colleagues of meat and bone. 


</p>
<p>
    Mark, the day manager, was more of the former than the latter. He was a few years older than her, in his early thirties, pudgy and self-satisfied. He’d banter with male staff about nights out on the booze or ching and adopt an over-friendly, patronising attitude with the women. Mark out in the wild, stalking the corridors of the hotel rather than watching porn in his office where he belonged was never a welcome site. Even less pleasant was him walking straight at her as she entered the lobby. “Sharon, there’s my ray of morning sunshine. Just a wee favour. You know Brian Scott, the lad who works in house-keeping? Seems he doesn’t fancy being a chamber-maid today. Sent in a message a moment ago that he’s sick. You wouldn’t mind switching over to the rooms just for today?” Li Juan can take care of the breakfasts.” Sharon nodded. She had reasons for preferring housekeeping to the breakfast room and had silently cursed Mark when he first transferred her. Dropping her bag in the staff room she happened to notice the Forthside Observer sitting on the table. She looked to see if there was anything else on the animal slashings. Instead there was a missing person’s case: twenty year old David Simpson had vanished from Forthside University campus and hadn’t been seen since last Friday. Finding the student’s plight less compelling than that of the cows, Sharon put down the paper and headed for the store room on the second floor.


</p>
<p>
	She was glad to find that the regular housekeeping staff were already on their rounds by the time she got there. The rota on the door said she had three departs and four make-ups. She stacked her trolley with towels and sheets and grabbed handfuls of tea and coffee sachets along with a pile of notebooks. The first time she’d done housekeeping, the older woman she went round with had shown her the universal method for bathroom cleaning in the hotel industry: old towels were moistened at the tap then rubbed round the water glasses, dragged across the mirror, scrubbed round the floor and finally used to wipe the toilet rim before being dumped in the laundry bag. The order was important, though often mixed up in the absent minded daze that comes on after about the fourth or fifth room, either that or the vengeful malevolence that naturally accompanies clearing up strangers’ pish. Sharon sometimes mercifully used a separate cloth for drinking glasses and tea cups, the never to be known act of compassion balancing out the equally unknown invasion of the guests’ privacy. 


</p>
<p>
    She always looked forward to the make-ups where the guests were just out for the day rather than having checked out. Nothing in her work at the hotel pleased her as much as these glimpses into others lives, and, if time permitted, the occasional really thorough rummage. Much of what she found was dull: boring self-help and business books, boxes of medicine for various ailments. But now and again, something would come up that broke the tedium: a notebook filled with handwritten poetry, a lovingly annotated copy of Mein Kampf, drug paraphernalia, the funny, gross, slightly exciting feeling of uncovering a sex toy. There’s a certain triumph in locating the enormous butt-plug lurking in the corner of some munro-bagger’s sock drawer. These, however, were rare pearls and she doubted that just four make-ups would yield anything much special.


</p>
<p>
    This was true of the first three, probably business travellers judging by the spartan lack of luggage. When she opened the door to room 322, however, she was immediately struck by a huge wooden box in the centre of the room, about the size of a small wardrobe turned sideways and lined with three enormous padlocks. The first question was how the occupant had got it into the room. The second was, of course, what was in there. She started exploring for clues but, apart from the box, the traveller seemed not to have left any possessions at all. That was until she looked in a drawer under the TV and found a pile of printed A4 paper, the first page entitled: How to Become a Vampire: a practical guide by Preceptor Asin Ningishzida. She turned to the next page and read:


</p>
<p>
    A common misconception about ascension to undead existence, derivable no doubt from vulgar popular literature and cinema is that the aspiring initiate must simply hope to come across a Vampiric Sire by pure happenstance and thus be granted the gift of unlife. The truth of the matter is quite different from such unworthy fatalism. Research carried out at great cost, shows there is a positive and active path into the Vampiric state, though the procedure is complex, difficult and entails a way of being incompatible with any vestiges of human selfhood.


</p>
<p>
    Sharon smiled with delight. If the occupant of the room was also the writer of the manuscript, he was wonderfully, magnificently, utterly demented and very possibly really engaged in an attempt to transform himself into a vampire. She glanced back at the wooden box. It was indeed big enough to accommodate a human form. And were those air-holes on the lid? She had already made up the bed but, now that she thought about it, the sheets had seemed deliberately and artfully disordered as if to give the false impression that someone had slept there when they hadn’t. Vampires, of course, didn’t slumber in beds by night but rather in coffins by day. Did she dare kick the box? If the “preceptor” really was in there, it wasn’t like he could exactly complain at reception or leave a bad review on Trip Advisor: “I was minding my own business in the room, pretending to be a vampire in a big padlocked box when a staff-member had the temerity to kick it! Service: one star. Very unprofessional.” She kicked the thing with a sturdy resounding thump.  Disappointingly nothing stirred inside the box and she had no choice but to get the trolley back to the store room so it could be locked at the end of the shift. Following a sudden impulse, she put the manuscript under her arm and took it with her. 


</p>
<p>

    Once she got back to her flat in Allenbrig, she made a cup of instant coffee and started reading over the sheets of paper. They continued in the same vein as the introduction: overwrought prose, occultic mysticism, lunatic misanthropy and the more she read, the more it seemed that the author was entirely serious. Could she find out more online? Unsurprisingly, there was no shortage of “I’m a real-life vampire” material across the internet but specific searches for Preceptor Asin Ningishzida and his manual came up short. People like the man in room 322 tended to have a large and entertaining online footprint, but if there was one, it wasn’t under that specific pen-name. Disappointed if this was the end of the road, she absent mindedly checked a local reddit for Forthside and felt a rush of icy adrenaline. Rumours were swirling round that the missing student had been found dead by police, and more significantly, that his body had been drained of blood. Other commenters claimed to have inside information that the attacks on cattle had also involved bleeding the animals. She’d never felt more certain of anything; the bloodshed was related to the pages sitting on her desk 

</p>
<p>
    Sharon decided not to go to the police. This was her adventure and she wouldn’t have it taken out of her hands before she’d reached finality. She spent another couple of hours reading the manuscript, then set off back to the hotel, planning to arrive before nightfall. If the staff in reception asked, she’d say that she thought she’d left something behind and wanted to look for it. But, as it turned out, they didn’t even look up as she crossed the lobby and stepped into the lift, pressing the button for the third floor. She came to 322 and looking out of the window at the end of the corridor to see the dusk falling, she pressed one ear to the door in hopeful anticipation of the sound of the box creaking open. Hearing nothing, she glanced back at the introduction to the manuscript. 


</p>
<p>
    ...the procedure is complex, difficult and entails a way of life incompatible with any vestiges of human selfhood. The initiate willing to take these drastic steps, however, will find that like attracts like. Even while burdened by beating heart and warm flesh, it is possible to pursue a mode of being that is so utterly cold, isolated and indifferent to the human race that it cannot but attract the Vampiric Sires by hidden laws of dark affinity.


</p>
<p>
    Suddenly, she realised there was someone in the corridor behind her. A black-clad arm reached past her side. A leathery grey hand with elongated nails brushed a card marked 322 against the pad on the door. Wordlessly they went inside. Sharon sat on the bed as Asin Ningishzida hunched over the box with a ring of keys, unlocking the padlocks and letting them fall one by one with soft thuds onto the carpet she’d hoovered that morning. He beckoned to her and she came close, looking into the box and seeing its contents: Brian Scott, the boy who had messaged in sick, was laying with duct tape over his mouth and his limbs secured to the base of the box with metal bands. He was conscious, in fact, at a pitch of alertness; she could see his pupils dilated in utter terror. The Preceptor spoke to her then, in a voice as lifeless as the desert, and made her his offer: an existence eternally among, but separate from humanity as the ages rolled onward. Absolute power to watch, observe, dispatch or spare the people of the world but never to participate in their collective life. Only one final step was required. The creature reached into the box and one of the long twisted nails entered the flesh on Brian’s arm, opening a vein and releasing his life’s blood.
