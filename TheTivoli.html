<h2>The Tivoli</h2>

<p>
    You know my famous uncle Alec once saw the great giant Diarmait Mac Uilleim in the flesh? Thinking of those days, you’ll picture mini-skirts, Harold Wilson, Lennon and McCartney, not ancient 40 foot tall humanoids striding across the earth. The famous un-photographability of that ancient race doesn’t help: those failed attempts with clusters of matchstick men craning their heads at bulks of empty space. Grist to the mill of cranks online who say the giants never even existed, that written accounts and material traces are mere fiction and fabrication. But, as reasonable people, we all accept that, strange as it seems, the 60s generation lived within the last years of the age of the Nephilim.

</p>
<p>
    The full story I finally got out of the old boy, one day when my aunt wasn’t around, was that it was all because of a girl he knew at Aberdeen University: Jeanie Marr. She, my uncle and his best friend Charles Scott had settled into a little trio soon after arriving. They’d similar backgrounds, in the lower upper-middle classes of three medium sized Scottish towns and initially bonded over a love of the novels of Ray Bradbury and Philip K. Dick. The two young men also shared feelings for Jeanie that they’d confessed to each other over whiskeys one maudlin evening in the Machar bar.

<p>
    My uncle claims he never dared imagine more than the tender rhythm of chastely erotic warmth in Jeanie’s presence followed by half-drunk mutual soul-bearing alone with Charles. I remember once pointing to the homoerotic dimensions of this and teasing him about his relationship with his fellow inamorato. “God, they teach you some amount of nonsense at the universities these days.” I also went to Aberdeen, though I studied English Literature, making for a more leisurely student-hood than that of my uncle, the illustrious architect to be. Charles, read Law and thus, in an act of supremely treacherous gumption, he was able to invite Jeanie to see the folk singer Hamish Imlach perform at the Blue Lamp the night before my uncle would have an important Architecture exam. Anyway, Alec really only liked classical music they announced casually. Remember at Charles’ parents in Montrose when he took off the Bob Dylan record and demanded to put on an LP of the Marriage of Figaro?
    
</p>
<p>
    So, Charles was the man and my uncle was out in the cold with his text books and lecture notes. A dark time, but he’s said since that he traces his later success to this period. It was then that he discovered the ability to retreat inwards on airy pilgrimages across the limits of abstraction, returning with new insights and cloud-built creations waiting to be translated onto the material plane. By the night before the exam, Alec had been in this state for over a week and had hardly spoken to anyone except the grocer. Meanwhile, Jeanie and Charles? We might imagine them holding hands in corners of Seaton park, perhaps kisses and more on silent spots up the beach promenade. But the part of the story my uncle was able to piece together starts the night of the concert with Charles in his best suit arriving to pick up the fair Jeanie. 
    
</p>
<p>

    Simultaneously with this developing liaison, Jeanie had recently been losing herself in The Lord of the Rings. (It’s notable that, although Tolkien includes men and women alongside his fanciful elves, dwarves and hobbits, there is only the most fleeting reference to giants in The Hobbit and none-at-all in The Lord of the Rings. It’s as though Tolkien’s imaginative recreation of the dark ages starts off by subtracting giants from the roster of real-life beings before adding in his many fictional races and creatures.) Middle-Earth, Charles and Charles’ beloved folk music; these three new-found interests merged together for Jeannie, making those weeks into an enchanted time. And her favourites of the songs Charles played for her were those that were poetic and evocative, that seemed to carry the listener far away to the magical lands Tolkien had described. 
</p>
<p>

    Imlach, a burly Glaswegian, was hard to associate with Middle-Earth or with the cafes of Greenwich Village. He had been on stage a while before the advertised starting time and it seemed that a good portion of the audience were personal friends, with frequent eruptions of laughter and cheers to adlibs from the stage which meant nothing to the couple. The subject matter of the songs was also, to Jeanie’s ears, un-poetic. (One was dedicated to an Italian communist, igniting applause and noises of approval.) But eventually, after they had been at their table for about four songs, he finally played something beautiful.  
</p>
<p>
    The notes came out of the guitar in a simple pattern, faintly lute-like, soft and lulling, while Hamish sang in a deep voice of a deep green wood and a knight and lady who’d oft meet there/ far from the bustle and the bonds of care.” Charles took her hand in his as the evening began to fall into harmony with how they’d imagined it. The final note stayed hanging in the stillness for a second before clapping began and Hamish looked round with a beaming smile. “Now that’s the kind a knight ah’ve a bit of time for. No buggering about killing people or any of that bloody carry on. The only quest he was on was to get his bloody leg over!” The twinkling eyes onstage alighted on the young couple. “Aye, you’ll ken all about that son!” The singer was clearly looking directly at them, necks were craning round. There were sniggers. But the worst was to see on Charles’ face a sly sheepish smile of male complicity. Jeanie took her hand back onto her lap. They stayed for a few more songs then she told him she’d make her own way home. “Ah Jeanie, all that wasn’t my fault, surely you must see that.” Some hours later, in the darkness of the deep Aberdonian night, a copy of the Lord of the Rings flew out of an upstairs window and landed in the frosty street below. 
    
</p>
<p>
    The next morning as my uncle emerged from Marischall College leaving the other examinees scribbling at their desks, he was met by the fair Jeanie and suddenly found himself with the prospect of a “date” (her words) that Saturday but, to his increasing panic, all he could find advertised in the Press and Journal were a couple of teen dances, an amateur  production of the Dollhouse and a revival meeting at Rosemount Baptist Church. Throwing the paper down, he set out into Aberdeen looking for the fates to drop the perfect opportunity into his lap.

<p>
    My uncle has always said that architecture originally seemed simply a promising career for a smart young man. He’d had no particular feeling for the possibilities of the built environment. It wasn’t until that day, walking and walking, looking in at every café and theatre and hall in Aberdeen that he started to really notice the unique features of the city: the stark uncompromising solidity of the granite tenements, civic buildings that mixed fantastical Victorian gothic with bulbous, and asymmetrical Scots baronial. A city of dreams: Aberdeen seemed to have been made for exactly that moment in his life. 
    
</p>
<p>
    There was nothing that weekend at His Majesty’s theatre, a concert at the Music Hall, but tickets were sold out. Finally at the Tivoli theatre he saw a poster: “This Saturday evening, a public appearance by the giant Diarmait Mac Uilleim. Four-stories high, more than 1,000 years old! The friend of kings and conquerors. You are cordially invited to meet a living witness to Scotland’s glorious history.” He checked the poster twice. He had the date of his exam firmly memorized and counting forward to the Saturday, yes the days matched! But wouldn’t he have heard of something like this? Especially now that the giant was more reclusive, his rare public activities were pretty widely reported: the annual meeting with the Queen, helping the coast-guard rescue sailors on a stricken cargo ship. But then again, perhaps he had missed the news while deep in his studies. The box-office was only open for another ten minutes and, quickly making a decision, he bought two tickets in the stalls. 
    
</p>
<p>
    Two days later, they sat in the darkness of the theatre waiting, The audience was sparse, and there were muttered doubts as to whether the giant would really appear. And if he did, what exactly was he going to do? Sit on a towering bar-stool holding a cigarette the size of a man’s arm and regale them with stories from his life, a la Frank Sinatra? The lights went down as thudding and clanging could be heard from behind the curtain. There was no music, no announcement, the curtain simply went up to reveal Diarmait Mac Uilleim in his ancient war gear, head knocking on the theatre roof, muscles like oak, his long white beard flowing down over his breastplate.
    
</p>
<p>
    The audience gasped with one breath as the giant took a thundering step forward, then stopped, looking confused. My uncle noticed then the glassy eyes and saliva at the corner of his mouth. The giant moaned and fell to his knees, the iron that adorned his body making a crashing sound. He began to strip off the huge plates of armour. There were shrieks and a panicked exiting of seats as a grieve was dropped over the stage, narrowly missing a party in the front row. Then, with eyes still vacant, the giant stood again, and began to dance. 
    
</p>
<p>
    The dances of the Nephilim are the stuff of legend as you know. Think of Marco Polo’s account of the giants dancing by starlight in the desert and the painting by Jean Bardin inspired by that incident, truly a masterpiece, the brushstrokes hinting at the strangest kinds of movements. I don’t know if the dance that my uncle saw that day was a distant echo in the giant’s wrecked and senile brain of that seen by Marco Polo but, cramped into the bounds of the theatre, he moved and flowed like water, like the flight of migrating birds or the flames of a crackling fire at night, no sound apart from the beating of huge bare soles on the boards of the stage. Then, as if passing through the stages of a dream, the giant ended his dance, looked outward, gave a look of sudden anger and howled.
    
</p>
<p>
	The audience, including Jeanie and Alec fled in panic and the police soon arrived but, surprisingly there was nothing in the papers later that week- perhaps the events were hushed up. If some theatrical agent had been taking advantage of Scotland’s only giant in his dotage it would have looked very bad for the city. Later that year, it was announced that Diarmait Mac Uilleim had passed away and by the time Ted Heath was in Downing Street, the giants were entirely gone from the earth. 
    
</p>
<p>
    I remember the first time I heard about what my uncle had seen. It was on an extended family trip to the giant’s ancient Feasting Hall a few miles up the coast from Nairn. As a child, the distortion of scale seemed comical, laughingly clambering up onto the platform that Diarmait had used as a stool and having my picture taken pretending to be a giant myself. As I said, my uncle didn’t always include Jeanie’s part in the story and I never found out what became of the relationship. But I suppose my point is that if you want to truly understand Alexander Macdonald’s masterpieces, the New Tokyo Trade Complex, London’s twin Aerial Stadia, the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh that emerges like an enormous beehive, half hidden within Arthur’s Seat, the secret lies in those few weeks: love-sickness, a search through Aberdeen for a place to take a woman, and the dance of Scotland’s last giant.
